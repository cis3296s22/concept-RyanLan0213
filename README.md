# Proof of Concept for INFINITY JUMP 
This document proposes a 3-D game that allows the player to pick an environment and jump on the blocks. The player would be using direction keys on the keyboard to control which direction the character would be jumping. The player would fail the game if the character has stepped on air and the game will be ended with scores. The movement of the character would be designed in 2-D while the effects and environment would be designed in 3-D..
