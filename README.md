# Proof of Concept for INFINITY JUMP 
Infinity jump is a 3-D game that allows the player to pick an 3-D preload environment and characters that jumps on the block. The player would be control the character to choose which direction they want to jump. Whenever a player successfully landed on the block, the new block will be randomly generated through within random distance away from the current block. The player could make a charge to jump further, the longer it charge, the further it jumps. The player has to make a prediction of how long they charge to make them landed on the block. If the player fails to land on the block, the game will be ending with a score based on how many blocks were landed.  The movement of the character would only be designed in 2-D plane while the movement effects and environmental effect would be designed in 3-D.
